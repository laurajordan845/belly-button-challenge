# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge for Laura Jordan

## Description
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore a Belly Button Diversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The interactive dashboard includes:
* An intro section outlining basic information about the study
* A drop down menu for the user to select the Test Subject ID Number that they want to see data for
* Basic demographic information for the Subject 
* A Horizontal Bar Chart that shows up to the top 10 OTUs found in the Subject
* A Guage Chart showing the frequency the Subject scrubbed their belly button
* A Bubble Chart showing the OTU data for the Subject
